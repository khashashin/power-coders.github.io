&nbsp;Arriving in a new country is never easy. Our students have to learn a lot about Switzerland as a country and society, and how it works. Therefore we want to support them with mentors at eye level throughout the whole program. The mentors work on a voluntary basis. More information concerning the mentoring you [find here](/mentoring/) (in German)

Are you interested to participate as a mentor?

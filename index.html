    <p class="is-lead">Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees, located in
      Bern at the <a href="https://www.effinger.ch/">Effinger
      Coworking Space</a>. The first 12 week training for highly qualified refugees
      will take place from January to April 2017.</p>

    <p>The 3 months coding academy is followed by a 3 months internship.
      The internship can be extended by another 3 months. The ultimate goal of
      the Powercoders pilot in Bern is the permanent placement of trained
      refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments in the Canton of Bern.
      Participation is free of charge (laptop, food and transportation are
      offered) and includes a mentoring program.</p>

    <p class="is-lead">Powercoders is a coding academy for refugees, located in
      Bern at the <a href="https://www.effinger.ch/">Effinger
      Coworking Space</a>. The first 12 week training for highly qualified refugees
      will take place from January to April 2017.</p>

    <p>The 3 months coding academy is followed by a 3 months internship.
      The internship can be extended by another 3 months. The ultimate goal of
      the Powercoders pilot in Bern is the permanent placement of trained
      refugees in IT-companies and IT-departments in the Canton of Bern.
      Participation is free of charge (laptop, food and transportation are
      offered) and includes a mentoring program.</p>

    <h2>Who we are.</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of Powercoders was ignited by Dita Prikrylova,
      founder of a coding academy for girls in Czech Republic
      (<a href="http://www.czechitas.cz/">Czechitas</a>), Cornelia Mayer,
      founder of a catering company where she cooks with refugees in Austria
      (<a href="http://www.topfreisen.at/">Topfreisen</a>) and Christian Hirsig,
      a serial entrepreneur from Switzerland, during the Young Transatlantic
      Innovation Leaders Initiative program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together with a local team they decided to launch a pilot in Bern. The
      local core team are:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>project lead: Christian Hirsig, serial entrepreneur</li>
        <li>mentoring lead: Sunita Asnani, social worker and <a href="http://www.sunitaasnani.com/">dance artist</a></li>
        <li>teaching lead: Pawel Kowalski, founder of <a href="http://www.iterativ.ch/">Iterativ</a></li>
        <li>school lead: Marco Jakob, founder of <a href="https://www.effinger.ch/">Effinger</a> and IT-teacher</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
